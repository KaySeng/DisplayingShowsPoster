# Frontend Challenge:

## Tests

1. Typography
2. Spelling
3. Consistency through out the page
4. Functionality validation - to make sure the title change to the correct colour when user hover over the title.
5. User Experience

## My Assumptions

- The maximum number of column is 6 and will not go any higher. 
- For any larger screen (eg. Ultrawide). column will remain at a maximum of 6 column and stay in the center of the page. Hence max-width is required.

## Reason for the chosen approach 

- The reason why I decided to use Flexbox is that Flexbox help makes design and build responsive web pages a lot easier. Since I am using Flexbox, Flexbox already doing a lot of responsiveness for me but I still go around to different pages to make sure that everything is displaying as intended. 
- I also followed the BEM naming convention to name my classes as this help to maintain the code readability and also make it easy if I want to convert my CSS or write my CSS in SaSS.

## What could I have done better if time was not a constraint

1. I would create a CSS class container to auto-resize images. This way, in any cases where I accidentally use an image that is bigger than the images used on the website. The size of the image will not affect the layout of the website.
2. I would spend more time looking for the right font to use and make sure I get as close to the expected result as possible.
3. I would like to test the result on real devices to make sure everything is displaying correctly.
